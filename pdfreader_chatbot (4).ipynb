       "[Document(page_content='ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting  \\nFY 2024 -- UPDATED October 1, 2023  \\n(October 1, 2023  - September 30, 20 24) \\n \\nNarrative changes appear in bold text  \\nItems underlined have been moved within the guidelines since the FY 2023 version  \\nItalics  are used to indicate  revisions to heading changes  \\n \\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the National Center for Health \\nStatistics (NCHS), two departments within th e U.S. Federal Government’s Department of Health \\nand Human Services (DHHS) provide the following guidelines for coding and reporting using the International Classification of Diseases, 10\\nth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD -10-CM). These \\nguidelines should be used as a companion document to the official version of the ICD -10-CM as \\npublished on the NCHS website. The ICD -10-CM is a morbidity classification published by the \\nUnited States for classifying diagnoses and reason for visits in all health care sett ings. The ICD -\\n10-CM is based on the ICD -10, the statistical classification of disease published by the World \\nHealth Organization (WHO).  \\n \\nThese guidelines have been  approved by the four organizations that make up the Cooperating \\nParties for the ICD-10-CM: the American Hospital Association (AHA), the American Health \\nInformation Management Association (AHIMA), CMS, and NCHS.  \\n \\nThese guidelines are a set of rules that hav e been developed to accompany and complement the \\nofficial conventions and instructions provided within the ICD -10-CM itself.  The instructions and \\nconventions of the classification take precedence over guidelines. These guidelines are based on \\nthe coding and sequencing instructions in the Tabular List and Alphabetic Index of ICD-10-CM, \\nbut provide additional instruction. Adherence to these guidelines when assigning ICD -10-CM \\ndiagnosis codes is required under the Hea lth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \\n(HIPAA). The diagnosis codes ( Tabular List and Alphabetic Index ) have been adopted under \\nHIPAA for all healthcare settings.  A joint effort between the healthcare provider and the coder is \\nessential to achiev e complete and accurate documentation, code assignment, and reporting of \\ndiagnoses and procedures. These guidelines have been developed to assist both the healthcare \\nprovider and the coder in identifying those diagnoses that are to be reported. The importa nce of \\nconsistent, complete documentation in the medical record cannot be overemphasized. Without \\nsuch documentation accurate coding cannot be achieved. The entire record should be reviewed to \\ndetermine the specific reason for the encounter and the conditi ons treated.  \\n \\nThe term encounter is used for all settings, including hospital admissions.  In the context of these \\nguidelines, the term provider is used throughout the guidelines to mean physician or any qualified health care practitioner who is legally acc ountable for establishing the patient’s diagnosis. Only \\nthis set of guidelines, approved by the Cooperating Parties, is official.  \\n \\nThe guidelines are organized into sections. Section I includes the structure and conventions of the \\nclassification and genera l guidelines that apply to the entire classification, and chapter -specific \\nguidelines that correspond to the chapters as they are arranged in the classification. Section II \\nincludes guidelines for selection of principal diagnosis for non- outpatient setting s. Section III \\nincludes guidelines for reporting additional diagnoses in non- outpatient settings.  Section IV is for \\noutpatient coding and reporting. It is necessary to review all sections of the guidelines to fully \\nunderstand all of the rules and instructi ons needed to code properly.', metadata={'source': 'cdc_133289_DS1 1.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

Conventions, general coding guidelines and chapter \\nspecific guidelines  \\nThe conventions, general guidelines and chapter -specific guidelines are applicable to all \\nhealth care settings unless otherwise indicated.  The conventions and instructions of the \\nclassification take precedence over guidelines.  \\nA. Conventions for the ICD-10 -CM \\nThe conventions for the ICD -10-CM are the general rules for use of the classification \\nindependent of the guidelines. These conventions are incorporated within the Alphabetic Index  \\nand Tabular List  of the ICD -10-CM as instructional notes. \\n1. The Alphabetic Index and Tabular List  \\nThe ICD -10-CM is divided into the Alphabetic Index , an alphabetical list of terms and \\ntheir corresponding code, and the Tabular List, a structured list of codes divided into \\nchapters based on body system or condition. The Alphabetic Index consists of the following parts: the Index of Diseases and Injury, the Index of External Causes of \\nInjury, the Table of Neoplasms and the Table of Drugs and Chemicals.  \\n \\nSee Section I.C .2. Neoplasms  \\nSee Section I.C.19. Adverse effects, poisoning, underdosing and toxic effects  \\n2. Format and Structure : \\nThe ICD -10-CM Tabular List contains categories, subcategories and codes. Characters \\nfor categories, subcategories and codes may be either a letter or a number. All categories are 3 characters. A three- character category that has no further subdivision is \\nequivalent t o a code. Subcategories are either 4 or 5 characters. Codes may be 3, 4, 5, 6 \\nor 7 characters. That is, each level of subdivision after a category is a subcategory. The final level of subdivision is a code. Codes that have applicable 7\\nth characters are sti ll \\nreferred to as codes, not subcategories. A code that has an applicable 7th character is \\nconsidered invalid without the 7th character.  \\n The ICD-10-CM uses an indented format for ease in reference.  \\n3. Use of codes for reporting purposes  \\nFor reporting purposes only codes are permissible, not categories or subcategories, and any applicable 7\\nth character is required.  \\n4. Placeholder character \\nThe ICD -10-CM utilizes a placeholder character “X”. The “X” is used as a placeholder \\nat certain codes to all ow for future expansion. An example of this is at the poisoning, \\nadverse effect and underdosing codes, categories T36- T50. Where a placeholder exists, \\nthe X must be used in order for the code to be considered a valid code.', metadata={'source': 'cdc_133289_DS1 1.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and  Reporting  \\nFY 2024  \\nPage 8 of 120   \\n5. 7th Characters  \\nCertain ICD -10-CM categories have applicable 7th characters. The applicable 7th \\ncharacter is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List \\ninstruct. The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field. If a code \\nthat requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in \\nthe empty characters.  \\n6. Abbreviations  \\na. Alphabetic  Index abbreviations \\nNEC  “Not elsewhere classifiable”  \\nThis abbreviation in the Alphabetic Index represents “other specified .” \\nWhen a specific code is not available for a condition, the Alpha betic \\nIndex  directs the coder to the “other specified” code in the Tabular List . \\n \\nNOS  “Not otherwise specified” This abbreviation is the equivalent of unspecified.  \\nb. Tabular  List abbreviations  \\nNEC  “Not elsewhere classifiable”  \\nThis abbreviation in the Tabular List  represents “other specified”. When \\na specific code is not available for a condition, the Tabular List  includes \\nan NEC entry under a code to identify the code as the “other specified” code.  \\n \\nNOS  “Not otherwise specified ” \\nThis abbreviation is the equivalent of unspecified.  \\n7. Punctuation  \\n[ ] Brackets are used in the Tabular List  to enclose synonyms, alternative wording or \\nexplanatory phrases. Brackets are used in the Alphabetic Index  to identify \\nmanifestation codes.  \\n ( ) Parentheses are used in both the Alphabetic Index and Tabular List  to enclose \\nsupplementary words that may be present or absent in the statement of a disease or procedure without affecting the code number to which it is assigned. The terms within the parentheses are referred to as nonessential modifiers.  The nonessential \\nmodifiers in the Alphabetic Index to Diseases apply to subterms following a main term except when a nonessential modifier and a subentry are mutually exclusive, the subentry takes precedenc e. For example, in the ICD -10-CM Alphabetic Index \\nunder the main term Enteritis, “acute” is a nonessential modifier and “chronic” is a subentry. In this case, the nonessential modifier “acute” does not apply to the \\nsubentry “chronic”.', metadata={'source': 'cdc_133289_DS1 1.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",

Use of “and”.  \\nSee Section I.A.14. Use of the term “And”  \\n9. Other and Unspecified codes  \\na. “Other” codes  \\nCodes titled “other” or “other specified” are for use when the information in the medical record provides detail for which a specific code does not exist. Alphabetic Index entries with NEC in the line designate “other” codes in the \\nTabular List . These Alph abetic Index  entries represent specific disease entities \\nfor which no specific code exists , so the term is included within an “other” code.  \\nb. “Unspecified” codes  \\nCodes titled “unspecified” are for use when the information in the medical record is insufficien t to assign a more specific code. For those categories for \\nwhich an unspecified code is not provided, the “other specified” code may represent both other and unspecified.  \\n See Section I.B.18. Use of Signs/Symptom/Unspecified Codes  \\n10. Includes Notes  \\nThis note ap pears immediately under a three- character  code title to further define, or give \\nexamples of, the content of the category.  \\n11. Inclusion terms  \\nList of terms is included under some codes. These terms are the conditions for which that code is to be used. The te rms may be synonyms of the code title, or, in the case of \\n“other specified” codes, the terms are a list of the various conditions assigned to that code. The inclusion terms are not necessarily exhaustive. Additional terms found only in the Alphabetic Index may also be assigned to a code.  \\n12. Excludes Notes  \\nThe ICD -10-CM has two types of excludes notes. Each type of note has a different \\ndefinition for use , but they are all similar in that they indicate that codes excluded from \\neach other are independent of each other.  \\na. Excludes1  \\nA type 1 Excludes note is a pure excludes note. It means “NOT CODED HERE!” An Excludes1 note indicates that the code excluded should never be used at the same time as the code above the Excludes1 note. An Excludes1 is used when two conditions cannot occur together, such as a congenital form versus an acquired form of the same condition.', metadata={'source': 'cdc_133289_DS1 1.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and  Reporting  \\nFY 2024  \\nPage 10 of 120  An exception to the Excludes1 def inition is the circumstance when the two \\nconditions are unrelated to each other. If it is not clear whether the two \\nconditions involving an Excludes1 note are related or not, query the provider. For example, code F45.8, Other somatoform disorders, has an E xcludes1 note \\nfor \"sleep related teeth grinding (G47.63) ,\" because \"teeth grinding\" is an \\ninclusion term under F45.8. Only one of these two codes should be assigned for teeth grinding. However psychogenic dysmenorrhea is also an inclusion term under F45.8, and a patient could have both this condition and sleep related teeth \\ngrinding. In this case, the two conditions a re clearly unrelated to each other, and \\nso it would be appropriate to report F45.8 and G47.63 together.  \\nb. Excludes2  \\nA type 2 E xcludes note repre sents “Not included here .” An excludes2 note \\nindicates that the condition excluded is not part of the condition represented by the code, but a patient may have both conditions at the same time. When an Excludes2 note appears under a code, it is acceptable to use both the code and the excluded code together, when appropriate.  \\n13. Etiology/manifestation convention (“code first”, “use additional \\ncode” and “in diseases classified elsewhere” notes)  \\nCertain conditions have both an underlying etiology and multiple body system \\nmanifestations due to the underlying etiology. For such conditions, the ICD -10-CM has \\na coding convention that requires the underlying condition be sequenced first , if \\napplicable,  followed by the manifestation. Wherever such a combination exists, there is \\na “use additional code” note at the etiology code, and a “code first” note at the manifestation code. These instructional notes indicate the proper sequencing order of the codes, etiology followed by manifestation.  \\n In most cases the manifestation  codes will have in the code title, “in diseases classified \\nelsewhere.” Codes with this title are a component of the etiology/ manifestation convention. The code title indicates that it is a manifestation code. “In diseases classified elsewhere” codes are never permitted to be used as first  listed  or principal \\ndiagnosis codes. They must be used in conjunction with an underlying condition code and they must be listed following the  underlying condition. See category F02 , Dementia \\nin other diseases classified elsewhere, for an example of this convention.  There are manifestation codes that do not have “in diseases classified elsewhere” in the title. For such codes , there is a “ use additional code ” note at the etiology code and a \\n“code first ” note at the manifestation code , and the rules for sequencing apply. \\n In addition to the notes in the Tabular List , these conditions also have a specific \\nAlphabetic Index entry structure. In the Alphabetic Index both conditions are listed \\ntogether with the etiology code first followed by the manifestation codes in brackets. The code in brackets is always to be sequenced second.  \\n \\nAn example of the etiology/manifestation convention is dementia with  Parkinson’s \\ndisease. In the Alphabetic Index, a code from category  G20 is listed first, followed by \\ncode F02.80 or F02.81 - in brackets.

See Section I.B.7. M ultiple coding for a single condition.  \\n14. “And”  \\nThe word “and” s hould be interpreted to mean either “and” or “or” when it appears in a \\ntitle. \\n For example, cases of “tuberculosis of bones ”, “tuberculosis of joints” and “tuberculosis \\nof bones and joints” are classified to subcategory A18.0, Tuberculosis of bones and \\njoints . \\n15. “With”  \\nThe word “with” or “in” should be interpreted to mean “associated with” or “due to” \\nwhen it appears in a code title, the Alphabetic Index (either under a main term or subterm) , or an instructional note in the Tabular List. The classification presumes a \\ncausal relationship between the two condit ions linked by these terms in the Alphabetic  \\nIndex  or Tabular List. These conditions should be coded as related even in the absence \\nof provider documentation explicitly linking them, unless the documentation clearly states the conditions are unrelated  or when another guideline exists that specifically \\nrequires a documented linkage between two conditions (e.g., sepsis guideline for “acute \\norgan dysfunction that is not clearly associated with the sepsis”).  \\nFor conditions not specifically linked by these relational terms in the classification  or \\nwhen a guideline requires that a linkage between two conditions be explicitly documented, provider documentation must link the conditions in order to code them as related.\\n \\n The word “with” in the Alphabetic Index is sequenced immediately following the main \\nterm or subterm , not in alphabetical order.  \\n16. “See” and “See Also” \\nThe “see” instruction following a main term in the Alphabetic Index indicates that another term should be referenced. It is necessary to go to the main term referenced with the “see” note to locate the correct code.  \\n A “see also” instruction following a main term in the Alphabetic Index  instructs that \\nthere is another main term that may also be referenced that may provide additional Alphabetic Index entries that may be useful. It is not necessary to  follow the “see also” \\nnote when the original main term provides the necessary code.', metadata={'source': 'cdc_133289_DS1 1.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and  Reporting  \\nFY 2024  \\nPage 12 of 120  17. “Code also ” note  \\nA “code also” note instructs that two codes may be required to fully describe a \\ncondition, but this note does not provide sequencing direction. The sequen cing depends \\non the circumstances of the encounter.  \\n18. Default codes  \\nA code listed next to a main term in the ICD -10-CM Alphabetic Index is referred to as a \\ndefault code. The default code represents that condition that is most commonly associated with the mai n term or is the unspecified code for the condition. If a condition \\nis documented in a medical record (for example, appendicitis) without any additional information, such as acute or chronic, the default code should be assigned.  \\n19. Code assignment and Clinical Criteria  \\nThe assignment of a diagnosis code is based on the provider’s diagnostic statement that the condition exists. The provider’s statement that the patient has a particular condition is sufficient. Code assignment is not based on clinical criteria used by the provider to establish the diagnosis . If there is conflicting medical record documentation, query the \\nprovider.  \\n \\nB. General Coding Guidelines  \\n1. Locating a code in the ICD-10 -CM \\nTo select a code in the classification that corresponds to a diagnosis or reason for visit documented in a medical record, first locate the term in the Alphabetic Index , and then \\nverify the code in the Tabular List. Read and be guided by instructional nota tions that \\nappear in both the Alphabetic Index and the Tabular List.  \\n \\nIt is essential to use both the Alphabetic Index  and Tabular List when locating and \\nassigning a code. The Alphabetic Index does not always provide the full code. Selection \\nof the full code, including laterality and any applicable 7\\nth character can only be done in \\nthe Tabular List . A dash (-) at the end of an Alphabetic Index entry indicates that \\nadditional characters are required. Even if a dash is not included at the Alphabetic Index entry, it is necessary to refer to the Tabular List  to verify that no 7\\nth character is \\nrequired.  \\n2. Level of Detail in Coding  \\nDiagnosis codes are to be used and reported at their highest number of characters  \\navailable and to the highest level of specificity documented in the medical record . \\n ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes are composed of codes with 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 characters . \\nCodes with three characters  are included in ICD-10-CM as the heading of a category of \\ncodes that may be further subdivided by the use of fourth and/or fifth characters and/or sixth characters , which provide greater detail. \\n \\nA three- character  code is to be used only if it is not further subdivided. A code is invalid \\nif it has not been coded to the full number of characters  required for that code , including \\nthe 7\\nth character, if applicable.', metadata={'source': 'cdc_133289_DS1 1.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and  Reporting  \\nFY 2024  \\nPage 13 of 120  3. Code or codes from A00.0  through T88.9, Z00 -Z99.8 , U00-U85 \\nThe appropriate code or codes from A00.0 through T88.9, Z00- Z99.8, and U00- U85 \\nmust be used to identify diagnoses, symptoms, conditions, problems, complaints or \\nother reason(s) for the encounter/visit. \\n4. Signs and symptoms  \\nCodes that describe symptoms a nd signs, as opposed to diagnoses, are acceptable for \\nreporting purposes when a related definitive diagnosis has not been established (confirmed) by the provider. Chapter 18 of ICD-10-CM, Symptoms, Signs, and \\nAbnormal Clinical and Laboratory Findings, Not Elsewhere Classified  (codes \\nR00.0 -  R99) contain s many, but not all , codes for symptoms.  \\n See Section I.B.18. Use of Signs/Symptom/Unspecified Codes  \\n5. Conditions that are an integral part of a disease process  \\nSigns and symptoms that are associated routinely with a disease process should not be assigned as additional codes, unless otherwise instructed by the classification. \\n6. Conditions that are not an integral part of a disease process \\nAdditional signs and symptoms that may not be associated routinely with a disease process should be coded when present. \\n7. Multiple coding for a single condition  \\nIn addition to the etiology/manifestation convention that requires two codes to fully describe a single condition that affects multiple body systems, there are other single conditions that also require more than one code. “Use additional code” notes are found in the Tabular List  at codes that are not part of an etiology/manifestation pair where a \\nsecondary code is useful to fully describe a condition. The sequencing rule is the same as the etiology/manifestation pair, “use additional code” indicates that a secondary code should be added, if known.  For example, for bacterial infections that are not included in chapter 1, a secondary code from category B95, Streptococ cus, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus , as the cause of \\ndiseases classified elsewhere, or B96, Other bacterial agents as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere, may be required to identify the bacterial organism causing the infection. A “use additional code” note will normally be found at the infectious disease code, indicating a need for the organism code to be added as a secondary code. \\n \\n“Code first” notes are also under certain codes that are not specifically manifestation codes but may be due to an underlying cause. When there is  a “code first” note and an \\nunderlying condition is present , the underlying condition should be sequenced first , if \\nknown. \\n \\n“Code, if applicable, any causal condition first” notes indicate that this code may be assigned as a principal diagnosis when the causal condition is unknown or not applicable. If a causal condition is known, then the code for that condition should be sequenced as the principal or first -listed diagnosis.', metadata={'source': 'cdc_133289_DS1 1.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and  Reporting  \\nFY 2024  \\nPage 14 of 120  Multiple codes may be needed for sequela, complica tion codes and obstetric codes to \\nmore fully describe a condition. See the specific guidelines for these conditions for \\nfurther instruction.  \\n8. Acute and Chronic Conditions  \\nIf the same condition is described as both acute (subacute) and chronic, and separate subentries exist in the Alphabetic Index at the same indentation level, code both and sequence the acute (subacute) code first.  \\n9. Combination Code  \\nA combination code is a single code used to classify:  Two diagnoses, or  \\nA diagnosis with an associated secondary process (manifestation)  \\nA diagnosis with an associated complication  \\n Combination codes are identified by referring to subterm entries in the Alphabetic Index and by reading the inclusion and exclusion notes in the Tabular List.  \\n Assign only the combination code when that code fully identifies the diagnostic conditions involved or when the Alphabetic Index so directs. Multiple coding should not be used when the classification provides a combination code that clearly identifies all of the elements documented in the diagnosis. When the combination code lacks necessary specificity in describing the manifestation or complication, an additional code should be used as a secondary code.  \\n10. Sequela  (Late Effects) \\nA sequela is the residual effe ct (condition produced) after the acute phase of an illness \\nor injury has terminated. There is no time limit on when a sequela code can be used. The residual may be apparent early, such as in cerebral  infarction , or it may occur \\nmonths or years later, such as that due to a previous injury. Examples of sequela include: scar formation resulting from a burn, deviated septum due to a nasal fracture, and infertility due to tubal occlusion from old tuberculosis. Coding of sequela  generally \\nrequires two codes sequ enced in the following order: t he condition or nature of the \\nsequela is sequenced first. The sequela code is sequenced second.  \\n An exception to the above guidelines are those instances where the code for the sequela is followed by a manifestation code identified in the Tabular List and title, or the sequela code has been expanded (at the fourth, fifth  or sixth character  levels) to include \\nthe manifestation(s). The code for the acute phase of an illness or injury that led to the sequela is never used with a code for the late effect.  \\n \\nSee Section I.C.9.

Impending or Threatened Condition  \\nCode any condition described at the time of discharge as “impending” or “threatened” \\nas follows:  \\nIf it did occur, code as confirmed diagnosis. If it did not occur, reference the Alphabetic Index to determine if the condition has a subentry term for “impending” or “threatened” and also reference main term entries for “Impending” and for “Threatened.”  \\nIf the subterms are listed, assign the given code.  \\nIf the subterms are not listed, code the existing underlying condition(s) and not the condition described as impending or threatened.  \\n12. Reporting Same Diagnosis Code More than Once  \\nEach unique ICD-10-CM diagnosis code may be reported only once for an encounter. \\nThis applies to bilateral conditions when there are no distinct codes identifying laterality  \\nor two different conditions classified to the same ICD-10-CM diagnosis code. \\n13. Laterality  \\nSome ICD -10-CM codes  indicate  laterality , specifying whether the condition occurs on \\nthe left, right or is bilateral . If no bilateral code  is provided and the condition is bilateral, \\nassign separate codes for both the left and right side. If the side is not identified in the \\nmedical  record, assign the code for the unspecified side. \\n When a patient has a bilater al condition and each side  is treated during separate \\nencounters, assign the \"bilateral\" code (as the condition still exists on both sides ), \\nincluding for the encounter to treat the first side . For the second encounter for treatment \\nafter one side has previously been treated and the condition no longer exists on that side, assign the appropriate unilateral code for the side where the condition still exists \\n(e.g., cataract surgery performed on e ach eye in separate encounters). The bilateral code \\nwould not be assigned for the  subsequent encounter , as the patient no longer has the \\ncondi tion in the previously- treated site. If the treatment on the first side did not \\ncompletely resolve the condition, then the bilateral code would still be appropriate.  \\n \\nWhen laterality is not documented by the patient’s provider, code assignment for the affected side may be based on medical record documentation from other clinicians. If there is conflicting medical reco rd documentation regarding the affected side, the \\npatient’s provider should be queried for clarification. Codes for “unspecified” side should rarely be used, such as when the documentation in the record is insufficient to determine the affected side and it  is not possible to obtain clarification.  \\n14. Documentation by Clinicians Other than the Patient\\'s Provider  \\nCode assignment is based on the documentation by the  patient\\'s provider (i.e., physician \\nor other qualified healthcare practitioner legally accountable for establishing the patient\\'s diagnosis). There are a few exceptions  when  code assignment may be based on \\nmedical record documentation from clinicians who are not the patient’s provider (i.e., physician or other qualified healthcare practitioner legally a ccountable for establishing \\nthe patient’s diagnosis ). In this context, “clinicians” other than the patient’s provider \\nrefer to healthcare professionals permitted, based on regulatory or accreditation', metadata={'source': 'cdc_133289_DS1 1.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n",

However, the associated diagnosis (such as overweight, obesity, acute \\nstroke , pressure ulcer , or a condition classifiable to category F10, Alcohol related \\ndisorders ) must be documented by the patient’s provider. If there is conflicting medical \\nrecord documentation, either from the same clinician or different clinicians, the patient’s provider should be queried for clarification.  The BMI, coma scale, NIHSS, blood alcohol level  codes , codes for social determinants \\nof health  and underimmunization status  should only be reported as secondary diagnoses. \\n See Section I.C.21.c.17. for additional information regarding coding social determinants of health. \\n15. Syndromes  \\nFollow the Alphabetic Index guidance when coding syndromes. In the absence of Alphabetic Index guidance, assign codes for the documented manifestations of the syndrome. Additional codes for manifestations that are not an integral part of the disease process may also be assigned when the condition does not have a unique code.  \\n16. Documentation of Complications of Care  \\nCode assignment is based on the provider’s documentation of the relationship between the condition and the care or procedure , unless otherwise instructed by the \\nclassification . The guideline extends to any complications of care, regardless of the \\nchapter the code is located in. It is important to note that not all conditions that occur during or following medical care or surgery are classified as complications . There must \\nbe a cause- and-effect relationship between the care provided and the condition, and the  \\ndocumentation must support that the condition is clinically significant. It is not \\nnecessary for the provider to explicitly document the term  “complication.”  For example, \\nif the condition alters the course of the surgery as documented in the operative report, then it would be appropriate to report a complication code.

Borderline Diagnosis  \\nIf the provider documents a \"borderline\" diagnosis at the time of discharge, the \\ndiagnosis is coded a s confirmed, unless the classification provides a specific entry (e.g., \\nborderline diabetes). If a borderline condition has a specific index entry in ICD -10-CM, \\nit should be coded as such. Since borderline conditions are not uncertain diagnoses, no distinc tion is made between the care setting (inpatient versus outpatient). Whenever the \\ndocumentation is unclear regarding a borderline condition, coders are encouraged to query for clarification. \\n18. Use of Sign/Symptom/Unspecified Codes  \\nSign/symptom and “unspecifi ed” codes have acceptable, even necessary, uses. While \\nspecific diagnosis codes should be reported when they are supported by the available medical record documentation and clinical knowledge of the patient’s health condition, there are instances when sign s/symptoms or unspecified codes are the best choices for \\naccurately reflecting the healthcare encounter. Each healthcare encounter should be coded to the level of certainty known for that encounter.  As stated in the introductory section of these official coding guidelines, a joint effort between the healthcare provider and the coder is essential to achieve complete and accurate documentation, code assignment, and reporting of diagnoses and procedures. The importance of consistent, complete documentation in the medical record cannot be overemphasized. Without such documentation accurate coding cannot be achieved. The entire record should be reviewed to determine the specific reason for the encounter and the conditions treated.  \\n If a definitive diagnosis has not been established by the end of the encounter, it is appropriate to report codes for sign(s) and/or symptom(s) in lieu of a definitive diagnosis. When sufficient clinical information isn’t known or available about a particular health condition to assign a more specific code, it is acceptable to report the appropriate “unspecified” code (e.g., a diagnosis of pneumonia has been determined, but not the specific type). Unspecified codes should be reported when they are the codes that most accurately  reflect what is known about the patient’s condition at the time of \\nthat particular encounter. It would be inappropriate to select a specific code that is not supported by the medical record documentation or conduct medically unnecessary \\ndiagnostic testing  in order to determine a more specific code.  \\n19. Coding for Healthcare Encounters in Hurricane Aftermath  \\na. Use of External Cause of Morbidity Codes  \\nAn external cause of morbidity code should be assigned to identify the cause of the \\ninjury(ies)  incurred as a resu lt of the hurricane. The use of external cause of \\nmorbidity codes is supplemental to the application of ICD -10-CM codes. External \\ncause of morbidity codes are never to be recorded as a principal diagnosis (first -\\nlisted in non- inpatient settings). The appropriate injury code should be sequenced \\nbefore any external cause codes. The external cause of morbidity codes capture how the injury or health condition happened (cause), the intent (unintentional or accidental; or intentional, such as suicide or assault), the place where the event occurred, the activity of the patient at the time of the event, and the person’s status', metadata={'source': 'cdc_133289_DS1 1.pdf', 'page': 16}),\n",

They should not be assigned for encounters to treat \\nhurricane victims’ medical conditions when no injury, adverse  effect or poisoning is \\ninvolved. External cause of morbidity codes should be assigned for each encounter for care and treatment of the injury. External cause of morbidity codes may be assigned in all health care settings. For the purpose of capturing complete and accurate ICD -10-CM data in the aftermath of the hurricane, a healthcare setting \\nshould be considered as any location where medical care is provided by licensed healthcare professionals.  \\nb. Sequencing of External Causes of Morbidity Codes  \\nCodes for cataclysmic events, such as a hurricane, take priority over all other external cause codes except child and adult abuse and terrorism and should be sequenced before other external cause of injury codes. Assign as many external cause of morbidity codes as necessary to fully explain each cause. For example, if an injury occurs as a result of a building collapse during the hurricane, external cause codes for both the hurricane and the building collapse should be assigned, with the external causes cod e for hurricane being sequenced as the first external \\ncause code. For injuries incurred as a direct result of the hurricane, assign the appropriate code(s) for the injuries, followed by the code X37.0 -, Hurricane (with \\nthe appropriate 7th character), and a ny other applicable external cause of injury \\ncodes. Code X37.0-  also should be assigned when an injury is incurred as a result of \\nflooding caused by a levee breaking related to the hurricane. Code X38.- , Flood \\n(with the appropriate 7th character), should be assigned when an injury is from flooding resulting directly from the storm. Code X36.0.- , Collapse of dam or man-\\nmade structure, should not be assigned when the cause of the collapse is due to the hurricane. Use of code X36.0-  is limited to collapses of man -made structures due to \\nearth surface movements, not due to storm surges directly from a hurricane.  \\nc. Other External Causes of Morbidity Code Issues  \\nFor injuries that are not a direct result of the hurricane, such as an evacuee that has incurred an injur y as a result of a motor vehicle accident, assign the appropriate \\nexternal cause of morbidity code(s) to describe the cause of the injury, but do not assign code X37.0- , Hurricane. If it is not clear whether the injury was a direct result \\nof the hurricane, assume the injury is due to the hurricane and assign code X37.0- , \\nHurricane, as well as any other applicable external cause of morbidity codes. In addition to code X37.0- , Hurricane, other possible applicable external cause of \\nmorbidity codes include:  \\n \\nX30-, Exposure to excessive natural heat  \\nX31-, Exposure to excessive natural cold  \\nX38-, Flood  \\nd.

Chapter 2: Neoplasms (C00 -D49 ) \\n General Guidelines  \\nChapter 2 of the ICD-10-CM contains the codes for most benign and all malignant \\nneoplasms. Certain benign neoplasms, such as prostatic adenomas, may be found in the specific body system chapters. To properly code a neoplasm , it is necessary to \\ndetermine from the record if the neopl asm is benign, in- situ, malignant, or of uncertain \\nhistologic behavior. If malignant, any secondary (metastatic) sites should also be determined.  \\n Primary malignant neoplasms overlapping site boundaries  \\n \\nA primary malignant neoplasm that overlaps two or more contiguous (next to each other) sites should be classified to the subcategory/code .8 ('overlapping lesion'), unless the combination is specifically indexed elsewhere. For multiple neoplasms of the same site that are not contiguous such as tumors in dif ferent quadrants of the \\nsame breast, codes for each site should be assigned. \\n Malignant neoplasm of ectopic tissue  \\n \\nMalignant neoplasms of ectopic tissue are to be coded to the site of origin mentioned, e.g., ectopic pancreatic malignant neoplasms involving the stomach are coded to malignant neoplasm of pancreas, unspecified (C25.9).  \\n \\nThe neoplasm table in the Alphabetic Index should be referenced first. However, if the histological term is documented, that term should be referenced first, rather than going \\nimmediately to the Neoplasm Table, in order to determine which column in the Neoplasm Table is appropriate. For example, if the documentation indicates “adenoma,” \\nrefer to the term in the Alphabetic Index to review the entries under this term and the instructional note to “see also neoplasm, by site, benign.” The table provides the pr oper \\ncode based on the type of neoplasm and the site. It is important to select the proper column in the table that corresponds to the type of neoplasm. The Tabular List  should \\nthen be referenced to verify that the correct code has been selected from the t able and \\nthat a more specific site code does not exist.  See Section I.C.21.

Application of 7th Charac ters in Chapter 19  \\nMost categories in chapter 19 have a 7th character requirement  for each \\napplicable code. Most categories in this chapter have three 7th character values  \\n(with the exception of  fractures): A, initial encounter, D, subsequent encounter \\nand S, sequela. Categories for traumatic fractures have additional 7th character \\nvalues . While the patient may be seen by a new or different provider over the \\ncourse of treatment for an injury, ass ignment  of the 7th character is based on \\nwhether the patient is undergoing active treatment and not whether the provider \\nis seeing the patient for the first time.  \\n \\nFor complication codes, active treatment refers to treatment for the condition \\ndescribed by the code, even though it may be related to an earlier precipitating \\nproblem. For example, code T8 4.50X A, Infection an d inflammatory reaction \\ndue to unspecified inte rnal joint prosthesis , initial encounter, is used when active \\ntreatment is provided for the infection, even though the condition relates to the \\nprosthetic device, implant or graft that was placed at a previous encounter.  \\n \\n7th character  “A”, initial encount er is used for each encounter where the patient \\nis receiving active treatment for the  condition.  \\n 7\\nth character  “D” subsequent encounter is used for encounters after the patient \\nhas completed  active treatment of the condition and is receiving routine care for \\nthe condition during the healing or recovery phase.  The aftercare Z codes should not be used for aftercare for conditions such as  \\ninjuries  or poisonings, where 7\\nth characters are provided to identify subsequent \\ncare. For example, f or aftercare of an i njury, assign the acute injury code with \\nthe 7th character “D” (subsequent encounter).  \\n 7\\nth character  “S”, sequela, is for use for complications or conditions that arise as \\na direct result of a condition, such as scar formation after a burn. The scars are sequelae of the burn. When using 7\\nth character “S”, it is necessary to use both \\nthe injury code that precipitated the sequela and the code for the sequela itself. \\nThe “S” is added only to the injury code , not the sequela code. The 7th character  \\n“S” identifies  the injury responsible for the sequela. The specific type of sequela \\n(e.g. scar) is sequenced first, followed by the injury code.  \\n \\nSee Section I.B.10.

It indicates that a patient is being seen to receive a prophylactic inoculation against a disease. Procedure codes are required to identify the actual administration of the injection and the type(s) of immunizations given. Code Z23 may be used as a secondary code if the inoculation is given as a routine part of preventive health care, such  as a well -baby visit. \\n3) Status  \\nStatus codes indicate that a patient is either a carrier of a disease or has the sequelae or residual of a past disease or condition.

If the complication is classified to the T80 -T88 series and the code lacks the necessary sp ecificity in describing the \\ncomplication, an additional code for the specific complication should be assigned. \\nH. Uncertain Diagnosis  \\nIf the diagnosis documented at the time of discharge is qualified as “probable ,” “suspected ,” \\n“likely ,” “questionable ,” “poss ible,” or “still to be ruled out ,” “compatible with,” “consistent \\nwith,”  or other similar terms indicating uncertainty, code the condition as if it existed or was \\nestablished.

Admission from Outpatient Surgery  \\nWhen a patient receives surgery in the hospital\\'s outpatient surgery department and is subsequently admitted for continuing inpatient care at the same hospital, the following guidelines should be followed in selecting the principal diagnosis for the inpatient admission:  \\n \\n• If the reason for the inpatient admission is a complication, a ssign the complication \\nas the principal diagnosis. \\n• If no complication, or other condition, is documented as the reason for the inpatient admission, assign the reason for the outpatient surgery as the principal diagnosis. \\n• If the reason for the inpatient adm ission is another condition unrelated to the \\nsurgery, assign the unrelated condition as the principal diagnosis. \\nK. Admissions/Encounters for Rehabilitation \\nWhen the purpose for the admission/encounter is rehabilitation, sequence first the code for the condit ion for which the service is being performed. For example, for an admission/encounter \\nfor rehabilitation for right- sided dominant hemiplegia following a cerebrovascular infarction, \\nreport code I69.351, Hemiplegia and hemiparesis following cerebral infarcti on affecting right \\ndominant side, as the first -listed or principal diagnosis. \\n If the condition for which the rehabilitation service  is being provided is no longer present, \\nreport the appropriate aftercare code as the first -listed or principal diagnosis, unless the \\nrehabilitation service is being provided following an injury. For rehabilitation services following active treatment of an injury, assign the injury code with the appropriate seventh character for subsequent encounter  as the first -listed or princ ipal diagnosis. For example, if a \\npatient with severe degenerative osteoarthritis of the hip, underwent hip replacement and the current encounter/admission is for rehabilitation, report code Z47.1, Aftercare following joint replacement surgery, as the firs t-listed or principal diagnosis.

Diagnoses that relate to an earlier episode which have no bearing on the current hospital stay are to be excluded.” U HDDS \\ndefinitions apply to inpatients in acute care, short -term, long term care and psychiatric hospital setting. The \\nUHDDS definitions are used by acute care short -term hospitals to report inpatient data elements in a \\nstandardized manner. These data elemen ts and their definitions can be found in the July 31, 1985, Federal \\nRegister (Vol. 50, No, 147), pp. 31038- 40. \\n Since that time , the application of the UHDDS definitions has been expanded to include all non- outpatient \\nsettings (acute care, short term, long term care and psychiatric hospitals; home health agencies; rehab facilities; nursing homes, etc .). The UHDDS definitions also apply to hospice services (all levels of care).  \\n The following guidelines are to be applied in designating “other diagnoses” when neither the Alphabetic Index nor the Tabular List in ICD -10-CM provide direction. The listing of the diagnoses in the patient \\nrecord is the responsibility of the provider.  \\nA. Previous conditions  \\nIf the provider has included a diagnosis in the final diagnosti c statement, such as the discharge \\nsummary or the face sheet, it should ordinarily be coded. Some providers include in the diagnostic statement resolved conditions or diagnoses and status -post procedures from previous \\nadmission s that have no bearing on the  current stay. Such conditions are not to be reported and \\nare coded only if required by hospital policy.  However, history codes (categories Z80 -Z87) may be used as secondary codes if the historical \\ncondition or family history has an impact on current care or influences treatment.  \\nB. Abnormal findings  \\nAbnormal findings (laboratory, x- ray, pathologic, and other diagnostic results) are not coded \\nand reported unless the provider indicates their clinical significance. If the findings are outside the normal range and the provider has ordered other tests to evaluate the condition or prescribed treatment, it is appropriate to ask the provider whether the abnormal finding should be added.  \\n Please note:  This differs from the coding practices in the outpati ent setting for coding \\nencounters for diagnostic tests that have been interpreted by a provider.', metadata={'source': 'cdc_133289_DS1 1.pdf', 'page': 108}),\n",

Diagnostic Coding and Reporting Guidelines for \\nOutpatient Services  \\nThese coding guidelines for outpatient diagnoses have been approved for use by hospitals/ providers in \\ncoding and reporting hospital -based outpatient services and provider -based office visits.  Guidelines in \\nSection I, Conventions, general coding guidelines and chapter -specific guidelines, should also be applied \\nfor outpatient services and office visits.  Information about the use of certain abbreviations, punctuation, symbols, and other conventions used in the ICD -10-CM Tabular List (code numbers and titles), can be found in Section IA of these guidelines, \\nunder “Conventions Used in the Tabular List.” Section I .B. contains general guidelines that apply to the \\nentire classification. Section I .C. contains chapter -specific guidelines that correspond to the chapters as \\nthey are arranged in the classification.  Information about the correct sequence to use in finding a code is \\nalso described in Section I.  \\n The terms encounter and visit are often used interchangeably in describing outpatient service contacts and, therefore, appear together in these guidelines without distinguishing one from the other.  Though the conventions and general guidelines apply to all settings, coding guidelines for outpatient and provider repor ting of diagnoses will vary in a number of instances from those for inpatient diagnoses, \\nrecognizing that:  \\n \\nThe Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set (UHDDS) definition of principal diagnosis does not apply to hospital -based outpatient services and provider -based office visits . \\n Coding guidelines for inconclusive diagnoses (probable, suspected, rule out, etc.) wer e developed \\nfor inpatient reporting and do not apply to outpatients. \\nA. Selection of first -listed condition \\nIn the outpatient setting, the term first- listed diagnosis is used in lieu of principal diagnosis. \\n In determining the first- listed diagnosis the coding conventions of ICD -10-CM, as well as the \\ngeneral and disease specific guidelines take precedence over the outpatient guidelines.  \\n Diagnoses often are not established at the time of the initial encounter/visit.

Accurate reporting of ICD -10-CM diagnosis codes  \\nFor accurate reporting of ICD -10-CM diagnosis codes, the documentation should describe the \\npatient’s condition, using terminology which includes specific diagnoses as well as symptoms, \\nproblems, or reasons for the encounter.

The POA guidelines are not intended to provide guidance on when a condition should be coded, but rather, how to apply the POA indicator to the final set of diagnosis codes that have been assigned in accordance with Sections I, II, and III of the official coding guidelines. Subsequent to the assignment of the ICD -10-CM codes, the POA \\nindicator should then be assigned to those conditions that have been coded. \\n As stated in the Introduction to the ICD -10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting, a \\njoint effort between the healthcare provider and the coder is essential to achieve co mplete and \\naccurate documentation, code assignment, and reporting of diagnoses and procedures. The importance of consistent, complete documentation in the medical record cannot be overemphasized. Medical record documentation from any provider involved in t he care and \\ntreatment of the patient may be used to support the determination of whether a condition was present on admission or not. In the context of the official coding guidelines, the term “provider” means a physician or any qualified healthcare practi tioner who is legally accountable for \\nestablishing the patient’s diagnosis.  These guidelines are not a substitute for the provider’s clinical judgment as to the determination of whether a condition was/was not present on admission. The provider should be queried \\nregarding issues related to the linking of signs/symptoms, timing of test results, and the timing of findings.  Please see the CDC website for the detailed list of ICD -10-CM codes that do not require the use \\nof a POA indicator  (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/Comprehensive -Listing -of-ICD- 10-CM-\\nFiles.htm ). The codes and categories on this exempt list are for circumstances regarding the \\nhealthcare encounter or factors influencing health status that do not represent a current disease or injury or that describe conditions that are always present on admission.  \\nGeneral Reporting Requirements  \\n All claims involving inpatient admissions to general acute care hospitals or other facilities that are subject to a law or regulation mandating collection of present on admission information.', metadata={'source': 'cdc_133289_DS1 1.pdf', 'page': 114}),\n",

POA indicator is assigned to principal and secondary diagnoses (as defi ned in Section II \\nof the Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting) and the external cause of injury \\ncodes.  \\n \\nIssues related to inconsistent, missing, conflicting or unclear documentation must still be \\nresolved by the provider.  \\n If a condition would not be coded and reported based on UHDDS definitions and current \\nofficial coding guidelines, then the POA indicator would not be reported.  \\n \\nReporting Options  \\nY – Yes  \\nN - No \\nU - Unknown  \\nW – Clinically undetermined  \\nUnreported/Not used – (Exempt from POA reporting)  \\n \\nReporting Definitions  \\nY = present at the time of inpatient admission  \\nN = not present at the time of inpatient admission  \\nU = documentation is insufficient to determine if condition is present on admission  \\nW = provider is unable to clinically det ermine whether condition was present on \\nadmission or not  \\n \\nTimeframe for POA Identification and Documentation \\n There is no required timeframe as to when a provider (per the definition of “provider” used in these guidelines) must identify or document a condi tion to be present on \\nadmission. In some clinical situations, it may not be possible for a provider to make a definitive diagnosis (or a condition may not be recognized or reported by the patient) for a period of time after admission. In some cases , it may be several days before the \\nprovider arrives at a definitive diagnosis. This does not mean that the condition was not present on admission. Determination of whether the condition was present on admission or not will be based on the applicable POA guideline as identified in this document, or on the provider’s best clinical judgment.  If at the time of code assignment the documentation is unclear as to whether a condition was present on admission or not, it is appropriate to query the provider for clar ification.', metadata={'source': 'cdc_133289_DS1 1.pdf', 'page': 115}),\n",
